        <h1>The Magic Behind Microinfusion</h1>
        <h2>How it Works?</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The Glov Micro-Infusion System achieves its exceptional effectiveness through stimulation and infusion.</p>

    <p>First, it delicately "stamps" the skin with 24K gold 0.25mm clinical-grade needles, inducing controlled trauma.
        This prompts increased collagen production, naturally improving elasticity and diminishing fine lines and
        wrinkles.</p>

    <p>The needles, finer than human hair, guarantee a virtually pain-free procedure.</p>

    <p>Next, invisible micro-channels "infuse" your selected clinically-formulated serums into the skin's surface,
        amplifying absorption by up to 300%, resulting in visible improvements.</p>

    <p><strong>STEP 1</strong> Twist open the chamber of the device and fill with one ampule of serum. Twist to close it
        tight. Optional: You can mix two serums and fill it until itâ€™s 3/4 full.</p>

    <p><strong>STEP 2</strong> Once the serum has had enough time to make its way into the needles, you can take off the
        lid and start microinfusing!</p>

    <p><strong>STEP 3</strong> Start at the centre of the face and work your way outward to cover the full face. Stamp
        with a 50% overlap. Repeat 2-3 passes for better results. Leave the serum on overnight so your skin can drink up
        all those skin-enhancing ingredients.</p>
