# The Magic Behind Microinfusion
## How it Works?

:::

The Glov Micro-Infusion System achieves its exceptional effectiveness through stimulation and infusion.

First, it delicately "stamps" the skin with 24K gold 0.25mm clinical-grade needles, inducing controlled trauma. This prompts increased collagen production, naturally improving elasticity and diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.

The needles, finer than human hair, guarantee a virtually pain-free procedure.

Next, invisible micro-channels "infuse" your selected clinically-formulated serums into the skin's surface, amplifying absorption by up to 300%, resulting in visible improvements.

# How to use

## 5 Minutes Total, Every 2-4 Weeks

:::

**STEP 1** Twist open the chamber of the device and fill with one ampule of serum. Twist to close it tight. Optional: You can mix two serums and fill it until itâ€™s 3/4 full.

**STEP 2** Once the serum has had enough time to make its way into the needles, you can take off the lid and start microinfusing!

**STEP 3** Start at the centre of the face and work your way outward to cover the full face. Stamp with a 50% overlap. Repeat 2-3 passes for better results. Leave the serum on overnight so your skin can drink up all those skin-enhancing ingredients.
